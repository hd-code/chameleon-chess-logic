# Chameleon Chess Logic

This node module contains the game logic for the board game "Chameleon Chess".

Here you can find a description of the game and its rules:
- [english](./docs/game/en.md)
- [deutsch](./docs/game/de.md)

However, this module doesn't provide any kind of visual rendering. Instead, it is a library that implements the game logic of Chameleon Chess. It offers the basic models (data structures and functions to work on these data structures) that can be used to create an App or Website or any other kind of format to play a game of Chameleon Chess.

## Installation

Add this library to your project by running:

```sh
npm install git+https://github.com/hd-code/chameleon-chess-logic.git
```

If you are using the very first version of the chameleon chess app, you need to install the legacy version by running:

```sh
npm install git+https://github.com/hd-code/chameleon-chess-logic.git#legacy
```

## Usage

Now you can use this module in your app by simply requiring or importing it:

```js
const ccl = require('chameleon-chess-logic');
```

```ts
import * as ccl from 'chameleon-chess-logic';
```

This project is written in Typescript. So all declarations, interfaces etc. are included in the build.

## API Documentation

A complete guide on how to use this library, data types and functions, can be found [here](./docs/api/index.html).

## Development

If you want to work on this module you need the current version of NPM installed on your machine.

Then open your terminal and do the following:
