/**
 * This library is implemented in a functional style. Meaning that there is a
 * strict separation between data structures and functions. This file explains
 * all the data types, that are used to represent the game.
 * See [[./functions.ts]] for all functions in this library.
 * 
 * The most important type is {@link IGameState} as it holds all the information about
 * the game right now. It is an aggregation of subsequent types â€“ all are
 * described here.
 * 
 * _Note:_ Players are only represented by the enum {@link EPlayer}. This library does
 * not offer a more detailed data structure, because it is not needed for the
 * functionality. So, one of the first things you want to do, when implementing
 * an app/website or whatever, is to define your own player model.
